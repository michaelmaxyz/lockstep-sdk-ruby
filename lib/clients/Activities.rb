            #  An Activity contains information about work being done on a specific accounting task. You can use Activities to track information about who has been assigned a specific task, the current status of the task, the name and description given for the particular task, the priority of the task, and any amounts collected, paid, or credited for the task.

If you do not provide the name of a field, that field will remain unchanged.  This allows you to ensure that you are only updating the specific fields desired.
